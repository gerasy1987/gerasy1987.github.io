  abstract={Widespread acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial for achieving sufficient immunization coverage to end the global pandemic, yet few studies have investigated COVID-19 vaccination attitudes in lower-income countries, where large-scale vaccination is just beginning. We analyze COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across 15 survey samples covering 10 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa and South America, Russia (an upper-middle-income country) and the United States, including a total of 44,260 individuals. We find considerably higher willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine in our LMIC samples (mean 80.3%; median 78%; range 30.1 percentage points) compared with the United States (mean 64.6%) and Russia (mean 30.4%). Vaccine acceptance in LMICs is primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against COVID-19, while concern about side effects is the most common reason for hesitancy. Health workers are the most trusted sources of guidance about COVID-19 vaccines. Evidence from this sample of LMICs suggests that prioritizing vaccine distribution to the Global South should yield high returns in advancing global immunization coverage. Vaccination campaigns should focus on translating the high levels of stated acceptance into actual uptake. Messages highlighting vaccine efficacy and safety, delivered by healthcare workers, could be effective for addressing any remaining hesitancy in the analyzed LMICs.},

  author={Baranov, Alexey and Malkov, Egor and Polishchuk, Leonid and Rochlitz, Michael and Syunyaev, Georgiy},
  abstract={The paper explores various measures of institutional quality in Russian regions, and compares those measures to each other. Such analysis leads to the conclusion that Russian regional institutions are essentially multidimensional, and therefore comparisons of Russian regions in terms of their overall institutional quality could be problematic. New institutional indices are derived from Russian enterprise surveys held under the BEEPS project of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. Such indices yield a typology of Russian regions in terms of efficacy of regional administrations' control over economy and bureaucracy in their regions. Dynamics of regional institutional indices is investigated against the backdrop of Russia-wide institutional trends.},

  abstract={We provide a theory and empirical evidence indicating that the rotation of ruling elites in conjunction with elites' asset ownership could improve property rights protection in non-democracies. The mechanism that upholds property rights is based on elites' concern about the security of their own asset ownership in the event they lose power. Such incentives provide a solution to the credible commitment problem in maintaining secure property rights when institutional restrictions on expropriation are weak or absent.},

  author={Syunyaev, Georgiy and Polishchuk, Leonid},
  abstract={We study the impact of Russian regional governors’ rotation and their affiliation with private sector firms for the quality of investment climate in Russian regions. A theoretical model presented in the paper predicts that these factors taken together improve “endogenous” property rights under authoritarian regimes. This conclusion is confirmed empirically by using Russian regional data for 2002—2010; early in that period gubernatorial elections had been canceled and replaced by federal government’s appointments. This is an indication that under certain conditions government rotation is beneficial for economic development even when democracy is suppressed.},

  title={Federalism and Ideology},
  author={Wilke, Anna M and Syunyaev, Georgiy and Ting, Michael M},
  abstract={Classic arguments about federalist governance emphasize an informational or learning role for decentralizing policy authority, but in practice, ideological outcomes frequently motivate this choice. We examine the role of ideology in the allocation of policy-making power by modeling a two-period interaction between an elected central executive and two local governments.  Decentralization reduces the executive's ability to set policy and control externalities but potentially insures against future policy reversals.  In this environment, partial decentralization is a common outcome.  Complete decentralization arises when executives are unlikely to be re-elected, party polarization is high, and institutional hurdles to policy-making are big. These results help to clarify existing cross-national empirical findings on the determinants of centralization.},

  title={Persuasion without Deception: Why Propaganda Works Even When Its Bias Is Known},
  author={Syunyaev, Georgiy},
  abstract={Many autocrats use state-owned media to claim credit or shift blame for policy outcomes, often by shaping perceptions of whether central or local government is responsible. Are such strategies effective when citizens know the media is government-controlled? I present evidence from a survey experiment with over 4,000 Russians randomly assigned to watch news reports from the state-owned channel Rossia-1. The reports highlighted the central government’s monitoring of road maintenance and natural disaster management---both local responsibilities. Exposure did not shift beliefs about who is responsible, but it improved perceptions of policy performance and increased support for government. These results fit a Bayesian learning model in which citizens, aware of media bias and true responsibility, infer that the center associates itself with a policy only when performance is good. Propaganda can thus persuade precisely because citizens know outlets are state-controlled---an effect strongest among those who consume less state media and are more skeptical of it---providing further evidence for the Bayesian learning interpretation.},

  author={Syunyaev, Georgiy},
  abstract={Open and free media are often seen as crucial for political accountability, particularly in weak democracies and autocracies where they can catalyze regime change. Existing evidence supports this view but typically assumes that independent outlets are well known and trusted by the public. This paper tests that assumption. I field a panel 2x2 factorial experiment in Novosibirsk, Russia's third-largest city, exposing respondents to pre-recorded local news reports on a highly salient issue—public healthcare provision. Despite high treatment compliance, exposure to independent local news had no meaningful effect on beliefs about policy performance, responsibility attribution, or government evaluations. I also find no evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity across key pre-treatment characteristics. These findings suggest that the accountability-enhancing effects of independent media documented in prior work may be limited to outlets with an established reputation and audience.},

  title={Still Watching, Less Persuaded: Attention to News Reduces Authoritarian Propaganda Effectiveness},
  author={Shirikov, Anton and Syunyaev, Georgiy},
  abstract={State propaganda in autocracies often creates information bubbles, leaving citizens unwilling or unable to switch to alternative sources. This study shows that propaganda's sway can be decreased even without escaping such bubbles. In a panel experiment with 1,176 Russian citizens, we randomly assigned participants to analyze the reporting patterns of (i) propagandistic state-owned TV content only or (ii) both state-owned and balanced non-governmental TV content over four weeks. Two weeks after the intervention, both treatments reduced support for the authoritarian regime but did not undermine trust in or exposure to state media. Exploiting the differences in news channel composition across treatments, we find support for two mechanisms explaining these effects: increased attention to familiar media content and increased consumption of news from non-government sources. Subgroup analyses show that these mechanisms operate primarily among citizens who already exhibit skepticism toward the regime and propaganda.},

Users provide a causal statement of the form `X -> M <- Y; M <-> Y` which is interpreted as a structural causal model over a collection of binary nodes.  Then CausalQueries allows users to (1) identify the set of principal strata---causal types---required to characterize all possible causal relations between nodes that are consistent with the causal statement (2) determine a set of parameters needed to characterize distributions over these causal types (3) update beliefs over distributions of causal types, using a `stan` model plus data, and (4) pose a wide range of causal queries of the model, using either the prior distribution, the posterior distribution, or a user-specified candidate vector of parameters.},

  author={Hilbig, Hanno and Sichart, Florian and Syunyaev, Georgiy},
  abstract={Refugee integration is a core policy concern. Expanding on prior research on domestic policies and elite cues, we explore whether host-country debates about military aid to refugees' homeland shape perceived support, belonging, and return intentions. We implement a survey experiment with 2,631 Ukrainian refugees in Germany. Participants viewed authentic statements by German politicians with varying support for military aid. Average effects on integration outcomes are largely null. We then argue that this stems from moderation by the information environment. Using day-to-day variation in national news coverage, we show that without national Ukraine coverage, any experimental cue---supportive, ambivalent, or opposing---negatively affected perceived integration outcomes. On days with Ukraine coverage, our treatments had no effect. We propose that these patterns reflect a contestation mechanism: refugees treat the visibility of debate, rather than its valence, as evidence that support for Ukraine is contested and acceptance of Ukrainians in Germany is weaker.},

  author={Minson, Julia and Erlich, Aaron and Higgins, Christopher and Gans-Morse, Jordan and Syunyaev, Georgiy and others, 24},
  abstract={In response to Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, multiple citizen-led communication campaigns leveraged modern information technology to transmit millions of messages aimed at providing uncensored information to Russians via emails, texts, social media apps, and website commentary. But can such initiatives penetrate authoritarian censorship and propaganda, and does success depend on the types of messaging employed? To investigate, we partnered with Mail2Ru, a prominent citizen-led grassroots initiative, to conduct two pre-registered field experiments on the effectiveness of citizen-to-citizen email communication. We implemented a “mega-study,” inviting behavioral science experts to design theoretically informed persuasive messages encouraging Russians to watch a video about the war produced by an independent news organization. Approximately 260,000 email recipients were randomly assigned one of eleven treatments or two control messages. We report four key findings. First, information technology's scalability allows even poorly designed messages to reach and engage large audiences with uncensored information. Second, highlighting both the limitations and potential of citizen-led initiatives, nearly all expert-designed messages failed to outperform controls, but our top-performing message nearly doubled engagement with the video, a result successfully replicated in a second experiment. Third, effectiveness was strongly correlated with “conversational receptiveness,” the conveying of thoughtful engagement with opposing perspectives. Fourth, exploratory analyses offer suggestive evidence that messages from female senders are more effective. These insights into which messaging strategies can meaningfully increase engagement with uncensored information offer evidence-based guidance for citizen-led efforts to counter authoritarian propaganda.},

  abstract={Internet access is expanding in low- and middle-income contexts, yet its political effects remain unclear and may depend on how people connect. We study a pre-registered field experiment in a low-income South African township, where the high cost of mobile data constrains use. Around the 2024 national election, we randomly provided households with 8-12 months of uncapped home internet and cross-randomized exposure to an online get-out-the-vote campaign. Combining household surveys, verified turnout, and behavioral traces, we find that home connections increase in-person local political engagement—attendance at ward/community meetings and complaints to ward/municipal officials—while leaving voter turnout and online political participation unchanged. We detect no systematic shifts in political knowledge, views, or broad news consumption patterns. Evidence is consistent with a behavioral channel in which home connectivity raises time spent at home and incidental exposure to local governance and offline networks, with suggestive stronger effects among men. The results show that expanding home internet—distinct from mobile data—can strengthen place-based participation without mobilizing online activism or turnout, underscoring that the mode of access conditions the political consequences of going online.},
